 *the camera class updated..and:
 			*check if the axises are right or not :camera direction the z-axis and the upvector is y-axis ??
 			*??why in their code written one with negative and one positive : 
 					p0.add(right,-cam.sc_width/2);    ???
 					p0.add(upwards,cam.sc_height/2); ???
 
 *i added an assistant class .
 *i updated the return type of get intersection in Surfaces abstract class to t(was the intersection point)
